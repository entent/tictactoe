# tictactoe
Using reinforcement learning to create a tic tac toe playing program

Language is Python.  Using an Jupyter notebook because it is easier than writing scripts.

Credit to The AI Core whose code (https://github.com/AI-Core/Reinforcement-Learning) I based my work on.

Credit also goes to https://youtu.be/XpYz-q1lxu8 for a demo on how to make an interactive boardgame.
